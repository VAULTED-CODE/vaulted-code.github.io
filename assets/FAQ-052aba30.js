The optimised geometry of the  Rippmann Floor System (RFS) drastically reduces material use and embodied emissions, while improving on-site productivity and quality."},{Q:"For which applications/sectors are RFS floors suitable?",A:"The RFS is a “system” and can therefore be configured to accommodate a wide range of requirements and specifications. Multi-storey offices and residential, schools, car parks and data centres are just some of the current ongoing applications. As precast elements are most suitable for buildings with a good degree of modularisation and repetition, VAULTED helps your design team to optimise each project and get the most out of our system."},{Q:"Is the Rippmann Floor System certified?",A:"The RFS is designed and checked according to the corresponding structural and building codes in each region where we are active. Please check here (insert link - Company page) to see if we serve your area (e.g. SIA, Eurocodes, etc.)."},{Q:"Has the RFS already been applied?",A:"Thanks to more than ten years of research and development, the technology is now market-ready. To date, several full scale mock-ups have been built for a number of upcoming projects and the technology has been successfully applied in the HiLo unit at Empa NEST in Dübendorf, Switzerland, which is visitable upon request."}]},{title:"Design, Fabrication and Installation",questions:[{Q:"How can the Rippmann Floor System be used in your project?",A:"Simply get in touch and VAUTLED’s specialists will take care of designing the floors according to your specifications, coordinate with the architects, engineers and building systems providers, and estimate cost."},{Q:"Who produces the floors and in which countries are they currently available?",A:"We work with a trusted network of prefabricators, who are licensed to produce and deliver the precast floors according to our specifications. We currently deliver throughout Switzerland and we are expanding to Germany, Austria, France, Belgium and the Netherlands."},{Q:"Who can install the precast floors on site?",A:"Our precast floors are designed to be installed by any general contractor and are delivered with a minimal installation guidance. As part of our quality assurance, our in-house team attends the assembly of the floors to ensure the correct procedures are followed."},{Q:"Is special training or equipment required on site?",A:"No special training or qualifications are required. RFS floors can be installed using conventional means and lifting cranes."}]},{title:"Structural",questions:[{Q:"Which RFS floor is most suitable for my project?",A:"There are two types of Rippmann Floor System: single span (or RFS-S) for barrel vault configurations and double span (or RFS-D) for domed ceilings. The former is most suitable for rectangular bays (ratio of the longest to the shortest side greater than about 2) where you can have a beam on the sides. The latter benefits from bays with more square proportions and does not require supporting beams."},{Q:"Which span is the Rippmann Floor System suitable for?",A:"The RFS can be designed to accommodate any spans. Current implementations have featured RFS covering from 4.5m to 10.5m. Our team is there to help in optimising the building’s grid and minimise emissions and costs."},{Q:"What is the structural depth of the floor?",A:"The depth of the floor is fine-tuned on a project-by-project basis and depends on several factors, such as loads, building systems integration, architectural look, material savings and more. As a general “rule-of-thumb”, the structural depth of the floor can be taken as 1/15th of the longest span."},{Q:"What are the boundary support conditions?",A:"Double span RFS-D can either be point-supported on columns in the four corners or they can be linearly supported along boundary beams or walls. Single span RFS-S require linear supports in the form of load-bearing walls or beams."},{Q:"Is the RFS system only compatible with concrete structures?",A:"No. The RFS is in concrete but the substructure can be in any material (concrete, steel, timber, etc.), prefabricated or not."},{Q:"What is the maximum load that the RFS can carry?",A:"The RFS can be designed to resist any load typically associated with building uses. To date, applications concerned offices, residential, schools, car parks and data centres."},{Q:"Is the Rippmann Floor System unreinforced?",A:"Yes, there is no embedded reinforcement."},{Q:"Do RFS floors provide horizontal diaphragm action for wind and seismic loads?",A:"Yes. The RFS on its own provides diaphragm stiffness and capacity, which can be enhanced for special requirements though additional elements. This is coordinated on a project-by-project basis with the Engineer of Record (EoR) of the building."}]},{title:"Fire",questions:[{Q:"",A:""}]},{title:"Services Integration",questions:[{Q:"",A:""}]},{title:"Architectural Integration",questions:[{Q:"",A:""}]}]}),getters:{getSections(e){return e.sections}}});const m=Symbol.for("vuetify:v-expansion-panel"),he=["default","accordion","inset","popout"],me=y({color:String,static:Boolean,variant:{type:String,default:"default",validator:e=>he.includes(e)},readonly:Boolean,...S(),...se(),...j(),...U()},"VExpansionPanels"),fe=x()({name:"VExpansionPanels",props:me(),emits:{"update:modelValue":e=>!0},setup(e,l){let{slots:a}=l;oe(e,m);const{themeClasses:t}=Y(e),r=p(()=>e.variant&&`v-expansion-panels--variant-${e.variant}`);return C({VExpansionPanel:{color:b(e,"color")},VExpansionPanelTitle:{readonly:b(e,"readonly"),static:b(e,"static")}}),w(()=>n(e.tag,{class:["v-expansion-panels",t.value,r.value,e.class],style:e.style},a)),{}}}),ve=y({...S(),...L()},"VExpansionPanelText"),N=x()({name:"VExpansionPanelText",props:ve(),setup(e,l){let{slots:a}=l;const t=B(m);if(!t)throw new Error("[Vuetify] v-expansion-panel-text needs to be placed inside v-expansion-panel");const{hasContent:r,onAfterLeave:d}=ce(e,t.isSelected);return w(()=>n(ie,{onAfterLeave:d},{default:()=>{var i;return[D(n("div",{class:["v-expansion-panel-text",e.class],style:e.style},[a.default&&r.value&&n("div",{class:"v-expansion-panel-text__wrapper"},[(i=a.default)==null?void 0:i.call(a)])]),[[J,t.isSelected.value]])]}})),{}}}),$=y({color:String,expandIcon:{type:_,default:"$expand"},collapseIcon:{type:_,default:"$collapse"},hideActions:Boolean,static:Boolean,ripple:{type:[Boolean,Object],default:!1},readonly:Boolean,...S()},"VExpansionPanelTitle"),z=x()({name:"VExpansionPanelTitle",directives:{Ripple:de},props:$(),setup(e,l){let{slots:a}=l;const t=B(m);if(!t)throw new Error("[Vuetify] v-expansion-panel-title needs to be placed inside v-expansion-panel");const{backgroundColorClasses:r,backgroundColorStyles:d}=W(e,"color"),i=p(()=>({collapseIcon:e.collapseIcon,disabled:t.disabled.value,expanded:t.isSelected.value,expandIcon:e.expandIcon,readonly:e.readonly}));return w(()=>{var u;return D(n("button",{class:["v-expansion-panel-title",{"v-expansion-panel-title--active":t.isSelected.value,"v-expansion-panel-title--static":e.static},r.value,e.class],style:[d.value,e.style],type:"button",tabindex:t.disabled.value?-1:void 0,disabled:t.disabled.value,"aria-expanded":t.isSelected.value,onClick:e.readonly?void 0:t.toggle},[n("span",{class:"v-expansion-panel-title__overlay"},null),(u=a.default)==null?void 0:u.call(a,i.value),!e.hideActions&&n("span",{class:"v-expansion-panel-title__icon"},[a.actions?a.actions(i.value):n(ue,{icon:t.isSelected.value?e.collapseIcon:e.expandIcon},null)])]),[[K("ripple"),e.ripple]])}),{}}}),ge=y({title:String,text:String,bgColor:String,...S(),...Z(),...le(),...L(),...ee(),...j(),...$()},"VExpansionPanel"),be=x()({name:"VExpansionPanel",props:ge(),emits:{"group:selected":e=>!0},setup(e,l){let{slots:a}=l;const t=re(e,m),{backgroundColorClasses:r,backgroundColorStyles:d}=W(e,"bgColor"),{elevationClasses:i}=te(e),{roundedClasses:u}=ae(e),f=p(()=>(t==null?void 0:t.disabled.value)||e.disabled),v=p(()=>t.group.items.value.reduce((c,o,g)=>(t.group.selected.value.includes(o.id)&&c.push(g),c),[])),G=p(()=>{const c=t.group.items.value.findIndex(o=>o.id===t.id);return!t.isSelected.value&&v.value.some(o=>o-c===1)}),O=p(()=>{const c=t.group.items.value.findIndex(o=>o.id===t.id);return!t.isSelected.value&&v.value.some(o=>o-c===-1)});return M(m,t),C({VExpansionPanelText:{eager:b(e,"eager")}}),w(()=>{const c=!!(a.text||e.text),o=!!(a.title||e.title);return n(e.tag,{class:["v-expansion-panel",{"v-expansion-panel--active":t.isSelected.value,"v-expansion-panel--before-active":G.value,"v-expansion-panel--after-active":O.value,"v-expansion-panel--disabled":f.value},u.value,r.value,e.class],style:[d.value,e.style]},{default:()=>{var g;return[n("div",{class:["v-expansion-panel__shadow",...i.value]},null),o&&n(z,{key:"title",collapseIcon:e.collapseIcon,color:e.color,expandIcon:e.expandIcon,hideActions:e.hideActions,ripple:e.ripple},{default:()=>[a.title?a.title():e.title]}),c&&n(N,{key:"text"},{default:()=>[a.text?a.text():e.text]}),(g=a.default)==null?void 0:g.call(a)]}})}),{}}}),ye={setup(){return{FAQStore:pe()}},data:()=>({sections:[]}),created(){this.sections=this.FAQStore.getSections}},xe=F("h1",{class:"text-h2 text-white mb-16"},"Frequently Asked Questions",-1),Se=F("p",{class:"text-h5 text-white mb-8"}," Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
