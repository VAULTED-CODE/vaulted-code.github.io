The optimised geometry of the  RFS (RFS) drastically reduces material use and embodied emissions, while improving on-site productivity and quality."},{Q:"For which applications/sectors are RFS floors suitable?",A:"The RFS is a “system” and can therefore be configured to accommodate a wide range of requirements and specifications. Multi-storey offices and residential, schools, car parks and data centres are just some of the current ongoing applications. As precast elements are most suitable for buildings with a good degree of modularisation and repetition, VAULTED helps your design team to optimise each project and get the most out of our system."},{Q:"Is the RFS certified?",A:"The RFS is designed and checked according to the corresponding structural and building codes in each region where we are active. Please check here (insert link - Company page) to see if we serve your area (e.g. SIA, Eurocodes, etc.)."},{Q:"Has the RFS already been applied?",A:"Thanks to more than ten years of research and development, the technology is now market-ready. To date, several full scale mock-ups have been built for a number of upcoming projects and the technology has been successfully applied in the HiLo unit at Empa NEST in Dübendorf, Switzerland, which is visitable upon request."}]},{title:"Design, Fabrication and Installation",questions:[{Q:"How can the RFS be used in your project?",A:"Simply get in touch and VAUTLED's specialists will take care of designing the floors according to your specifications, coordinate with the architects, engineers and building systems providers, and estimate cost."},{Q:"Who produces the floors and in which countries are they currently available?",A:"We work with a trusted network of prefabricators, who are licensed to produce and deliver the precast floors according to our specifications. We currently deliver throughout Switzerland and we are expanding to Germany, Austria, France, Belgium and the Netherlands."},{Q:"Who can install the precast floors on site?",A:"Our precast floors are designed to be installed by any general contractor and are delivered with a minimal installation guidance. As part of our quality assurance, our in-house team attends the assembly of the floors to ensure the correct procedures are followed."},{Q:"Is special training or equipment required on site?",A:"No special training or qualifications are required. RFS floors can be installed using conventional means and lifting cranes."}]},{title:"Structural",questions:[{Q:"Which RFS floor is most suitable for my project?",A:"There are two types of RFS: single span (or RFS-S) for barrel vault configurations and double span (or RFS-D) for domed ceilings. The former is most suitable for rectangular bays (ratio of the longest to the shortest side greater than about 2) where you can have a beam on the sides. The latter benefits from bays with more square proportions and does not require supporting beams."},{Q:"Which span is the RFS suitable for?",A:"The RFS can be designed to accommodate any spans. Current implementations have featured RFS covering from 4.5m to 10.5m. Our team is there to help in optimising the building’s grid and minimise emissions and costs."},{Q:"What is the structural depth of the floor?",A:"The depth of the floor is fine-tuned on a project-by-project basis and depends on several factors, such as loads, building systems integration, architectural look, material savings and more. As a general “rule-of-thumb”, the structural depth of the floor can be taken as 1/15th of the longest span."},{Q:"What are the boundary support conditions?",A:"Double span RFS-D can either be point-supported on columns in the four corners or they can be linearly supported along boundary beams or walls. Single span RFS-S require linear supports in the form of load-bearing walls or beams."},{Q:"Is the RFS system only compatible with concrete structures?",A:"No. The RFS is in concrete but the substructure can be in any material (concrete, steel, timber, etc.), prefabricated or not."},{Q:"What is the maximum load that the RFS can carry?",A:"The RFS can be designed to resist any load typically associated with building uses. To date, applications concerned offices, residential, schools, car parks and data centres."},{Q:"Is the RFS unreinforced?",A:"Yes, there is no embedded reinforcement."},{Q:"Do RFS floors provide horizontal diaphragm action for wind and seismic loads?",A:"Yes. The RFS on its own provides diaphragm stiffness and capacity, which can be enhanced for special requirements though additional elements. This is coordinated on a project-by-project basis with the Engineer of Record (EoR) of the building."}]},{title:"Fire",questions:[{Q:"What is the fire duration resistance?",A:"The concrete floor is classified non-combustible (A1) and can be designed to provide resistance (R), separation (E) and insulation (I)  for up to 2 hours (REI120)."},{Q:"Does the floor fulfil REI criteria with respect to fire?",A:"Yes. The RFS floors are designed and detailed to guarantee their structural integrity as well as their fire/smoke compartmentation and thermal insulation function between floors."}]},{title:"Material, Embodied Carbon and Circularity",questions:[{Q:"How does the RFS compare to other market-ready floor solutions in terms of embodied carbon (EC)?",A:"The RFS has been successfully benchmarked against both conventional and state-of-the-art solutions. The amount of direct carbon savings is project-specific but in general it can be stated that RFS floors drastically outperform in-situ and precast concrete floors, and have lower CO2 emissions than hybrid concrete-timber composites and cross-laminated timber floors."},{Q:"Is there an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) for the RFS?",A:"Not yet, a full life cycle analysis (LCA) is currently in progress."},{Q:"Can the floors be disassembled and reused",A:"Yes. All of the details, both within the RFS floor itself and to the surrounding frame, are designed to be reversible. Thanks to the absence of embedded reinforcement bars, corrosion is prevented, leading to an extended design life compared to all other concrete floors, indeed allowing scenarios with 1:1 reuse."},{Q:"Can the unreinforced concrete be recycled?",A:"Yes. Thanks to the absence of embedded reinforcement, the floors can easily be broken down and be downcycled into recycled concrete mixes."}]},{title:"Services Integration",questions:[{Q:"Can sprinklers or lights be integrated into the floor?",A:"Yes. Ideally this is considered already during offsite manufacturing through cast-in details in the concrete shell intrados. Sprinkler pipes can penetrate the floor at multiple locations and recesses for cast-in features like flush ceiling lights can be provided."},{Q:"Can mechanical, electrical and plumbing services (MEP) be integrated into the floor?",A:"Yes. The upper ribs can be trimmed on a project-basis to allow the routing of MEP services in the cavities above the concrete shell intrados."},{Q:"Can the floors be drilled into, to attach the building systems?",A:"Yes. You can safely attach the building systems to the bottom shell of the floors. For large openings in the floors, a detailed structural assessment is required."},{Q:"Is the RFS suitable for Thermally Activated Building Structures (TABS)?",A:"In principle, in order to achieve a clear material separation for an uncompromised recyclability at the end of the life cycle, we would advise not to embed pipes directly into the concrete. Yet this is technically possible and indeed successfully executed in the HiLo floors in the NEST Building at EMPA, Dübendorf (CH)."}]},{title:"Architectural Integration",questions:[{Q:"Can a visual concrete appearance be achieved?",A:"Yes. By default the floors’ intrados is executed with a smooth finish. Customised patterns and finishes can be provided upon request."},{Q:"Can acoustical panels be integrated into the soffit?",A:"Yes. It is possible to either glue or mechanically fix panels directly to the floor intrados or to set them into recesses cast in the concrete intrados."},{Q:"Can partition walls be fixed to the soffit?",A:"Yes. Our bespoke detailing allows non-load bearing partition walls to be attached to the soffit at predefined locations."},{Q:"What is the acoustic insulation performance of the floor?",A:"The RFS has been tested to satisfy the stringent Swiss acoustic requirements, both in terms of airborne sound and impact sound.
